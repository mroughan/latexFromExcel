# excel2latex.pl

## Intro: 

the aim is to be able to incorporate spreadsheet information
into LaTeX in a flexible manner.

Tools exists as
  + [*Excel2LaTeX* a macro in Excel to output the spreadsheet in LaTeX
    format](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/excel2latex/)
  + [*exceltex.sty* a LaTeX style (in conjunction with a script) that will tak part of
    a spreadsheet and insert it into a LaTeX document.](http://www.physik.uni-freiburg.de/~doerr/exceltex/index.en.html)


The goal here, however, is do be able to do the latter, but a little
more flexibly. For instance, we might want to extract columns A, B and
C from the spreadsheet, and output them in the form of rows of a LaTeX
table such as
    B~\cite{A} & {\bf C} \\

Or we might want to output the rows into some other structure (not a
table). 

Also, while exceltex provides for including formatting from the
spreadsheet, our approach specifies that formatting will be defined in
the LaTeX document.

## Installation: 

## Instructions: 

There are three parts of using this:
  1. Include a "" command in the comments of a .tex file. This
     instructs excel2latex what to use to construct the table.
  2. A call to the script (which needs perl plus some packages).
  3. An include to pull in the resulting table.
